# Theme for Espresso
This is a theme for Espresso based on [Railcasts](https://github.com/Xac/railscasts.foam). It is dark and spicy. Beautiful and easy on the eyes.

It's far from perfect. If you feel like you could add anything, feel free to fork it and issue a pull request. Thanks!

## How to use it
1. Download the css file.
2. Launch Espresso and open the Preferences; on the Colors tab click on the Reveal in Finder button.
3. Copy the css file inside the Themes folder that has been opened and relaunch Espresso.
4. Enjoy my theme, star it here on GitHub and share it online!


Protip: if you don't really like my attempt, check out this guy's [D is for Dark](http://www.dermotholmes.com/work/d-is-for-dark-espresso-editor-theme/ "D is for Dark: beautiful theme for Espresso"). I love it, but mine is better.
